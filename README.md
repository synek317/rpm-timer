# Overview
RpmTimer (_RequestPerMinute Timer_) is a tool for limiting your processing speed to the requested number of items (e.g. requests) per minut.

# Getting Started

First of all you have to add this dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
rpm-timer = "0.0.1"
```

Next include `rpm_timer` crate in your `lib.rs` or `main.rs` file:

```rust
extern crate test_case_derive;
```

Finally, use `RpmTimer` in the mods where you are going to limit your processing speed:

```rust
use rpm_timer::RpmTimer;
```

# Examples

In order to avoid unnecessary memory alocations, `run` function has two version.

1. `run_slices` accepts slice and pass sub-slices to the processing function:

```rust
extern crate rpm_timer;

use rpm_timer::RpmTimer;

fn send_slice(requests: Vec<String>) {
    RpmTimer::default()
        .rpm_limit(100.0)
        .run_slice(&requests, send_http_requests);
}

fn send_http_requests(requests: &[&String]) {
    // process all requests here
}
```

2. `run_iter` accepts any iterator, collects items and pass every portion in `Vec` to the processing function:processing

```rust
extern crate rpm_timer;

use rpm_timer::RpmTimer;

fn send_slice(reader: BufReader) {
    let lines = reader.lines();

    RpmTimer::default()
        .rpm_limit(100.0)
        .run_iter(lines, send_http_requests);
}

fn send_http_requests(requests: Vec<Result<String, io::Error>>) {
    // process all requests here
}
```

Please check `examples` directory for more detailed, working examples.

# Description

`RpmTimer` works in tick intervals. You can adjust tick length with `tick` method. Every tick it checks if there are any free worker threads (the number of threads can be adjusted with `max_threads`) and how many items should  be processed in order to achieve requested speed. If any items should be processed, `RpmTimer` collects them to the either slice (in non-allocating version) or `Vec` (in allocating version) and fires processing function in the parallel.

Visualization:

Assume 2 worker threads and 500 ms tick time. Also, imagine a lag (e.g. cpu busy with other processes) between 2nd and 3rd second:

`60 RPM` = `1 RPS` = `1` request every `1` second
```
Time                     0   0.5   1   1.5   2   2.5   3   3.5
Main Thread:             |....X....X....X....X.........X....X..
Number of items 'ready'  1   0.5   1   0.5   1         2   0.5
Worker #1                1**********************.......2******.
Worker #2                ..........1**************.............
                                             ^         ^
                                             |         |- 2 items sent to the thread
                                             |- an item is ready but no worker threads available

```

`30 RPM` = `0.5 RPS` = `1` request every `2` seconds
```
Time                     0   0.5   1   1.5   2   2.5   3   3.5
Main Thread:             |....X....X....X..............X....X..
Number of items 'ready'  1  0.25  0.5  0.75  1  0.25  0.5  0.75
Worker #1                1***********..........................
Worker #2                ....................1************.....
```

Legend:
- `.` - sleeping
- `X` - main thread's _tick_
- `*` - busy with # requests
